Project Title: Promoting Mental Health Awareness Among Students

This project aims to create a supportive and educational platform dedicated to enhancing mental health awareness among 
students. By providing comprehensive resources, organizing engaging workshops, and 
establishing a safe space for sharing personal stories, we strive to reduce stigma, promote 
understanding, and offer valuable support to young adults navigating their mental health journey. 
Our ultimate goal is to empower students with the knowledge and tools they need to prioritize 
their well-being and seek help when needed
